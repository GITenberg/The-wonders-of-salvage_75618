summary: '"The Wonders of Salvage" by David Masters is a non-fiction account detailing
  the art and challenges of maritime salvage, written in the early 20th century. The
  narrative discusses the complex processes and trials faced by salvage experts as
  they work to recover sunken vessels and their valuable cargoes, drawing on both
  historical examples and the author''s own observations.   The opening of the book
  sets the scene with a vivid depiction of a seasoned ship captain navigating through
  a turbulent storm. As he skillfully guides his vessel, the text delves into the
  melancholic reality of shipwrecks, emphasizing the annual economic losses they incur
  and the aftermath of human negligence against nature''s might. Masters discusses
  the essential role of salvage workers, the complexity of their challenges, their
  relentless spirit, and the unpredictable influence of weather on salvage operations.
  The text hints at thrilling stories of treasure recovery, detailing the remarkable
  perseverance and ingenuity required to extract remnants of lost fortunes from the
  depths of the ocean. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
